This is the documentation of our repository VlogSimulator. VlogSimulator (or Vlog) allows users to select Basic or Premium Plan.

Hence two different channel modes:
- Basic
    - Users are prompted for an identification number
- Premium
    - Users are prompted for Credit Card information

When a video is posted (uploaded) on channel, it will notify all subscribers to that channel.

@tableofcontents
@section subsystemsection1 Channel

@section subsystemsection2 ChannelBuilder
Simulates a Builder for the Channel class (implemented as a Builder Creational Design).
@section subsystemsection3 Subscriber
Simulates a Subscriber for the channel.

> The relationship between Channel and Subscriber is a Subject-Observer relationship.
